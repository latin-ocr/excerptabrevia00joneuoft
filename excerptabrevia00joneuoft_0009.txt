PREFACE

 

This compilation is published at the request of
many readers of my little book, The Teaclzz‘ng of
Latin. The selections which I had already printed
for my own use, as described in the third chapter of
that book, were too few to offer to the general public,
and the task of finding a considerable number of
new extracts has proved far more laborious than I
expected. I have been fortunate enough to secure
the help of my colleague‚ Mr. R. Parker Smith, who
has chosen most of the historical passages, besides
giving other valuable help. 1 alone, however, am
responsible for any errors in the marking of quan-
tities. Only those who have done such work know
how hard it is for one pair of eyes to avoid errors
and omissions‚ and I need not add that any cor-
rections will be gladly received.

Part I consists of short passages suitable for
learners on their first introduction to a Latin text
after a year’s course, such as that given in Scott
and Jones's Fz‘rst Latin Course, on the simple sen-
tence. The blank page is for the teacher’s notes,
given either before or after the preparation at home;
references to the Latin grammar in use should be
added in the margin of the text. Other suggestions
will be found in the chapter of The T eaching ofLatzn

to which 1 refer above.
