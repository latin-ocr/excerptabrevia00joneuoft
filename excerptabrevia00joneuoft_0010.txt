vi Preface

Part II contains passages which throw light upon
Roman history, arranged in a rough chronological
order. Although extracts, they will be found to be
in many cases artistic unities. That splendid prose
epic in brief, the attack upon Cicero’s camp, is cer-
tainly more of a unity than, say, a “book’' of the
odes of Horace. The compilers have desired to find
selections which show why the Romans were a great
people.

All vowels long by nature have been marked, so
that the short mark is discarded as superfluous.
Nothing but good can come from the distinction, thus
unconsciously impressed upon the learner, between
long vowels and long syllables. In the very difficult
matter of hidden quantity, Gildersleeve and Lodge's
Latin Grammar has, in general, been closely followed.

I may add in conclusion that most of this book has
been tested by myself in class, and I believe that it
will be found suitable in point of difficulty for learners
in their second and third years, for whom it is prim-
arily intended. I have made no attempt to arrange
the selections in order of difficulty, in my opinion a
useless task. Part I, however, is much simpler than
Part ΙΙ, and in the former I have not hesitated to
alter the Latin of passages where it appeared too
difficult. In Part II such alterations are very rare.
